Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Design

# Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Design

## This chapter covers following topics
-  What object-oriented means
- The difference between **object-oriented design** and o**bject-oriented
programming**
-  The basic principles of object-oriented design
-  Basic Unified **Modeling Language (UML)** and when it isn't evil

## Plus some architectural view model like

-  An overview of a classic machine learning application, the famous Iris
classification problem
- The general processing context for this classifier
....
## What is an Objests?
- a tangible thing that we can sense
- an object is a collection of **data** and associated **behaviors**

## What does it mean to be object-oriented?
- In the dictionary, oriented means directed toward. Object-oriented programming means writing code directed toward modeling objects

## Object-oriented analysis ([OOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design))
> is the process of looking at a **problem**, **system**,
or **task** (that somebody wants to turn into a working software application) and
identifying the objects and interactions between those objects. The analysis stage is
all about what needs to be done

> The output of the analysis stage is a **description** of the system, often in the form
of **requirements**

### For example:
  As a botanist, I need a website to help users classify plants so I can help with correct identification, into a -> **set of required features**
  
  Italicts -> **actions**
  bolds -> **objects**

- *Upload new* **Known Examples**
- *Test for* **Quality**

- *See* **Recommendations**

## Object-oriented design ([OOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design))
> is the process of converting such requirements into an implementation specification
- Naming objects
- Define the behaviors
- Specify which objects can activate specific behaviors on other objects
> The design stage is all about transforming **what should be done**
into **how it should be done**.

#### What is the output of the OOD?
> The output of the design stage is an implementation specification. If we were to
complete the design stage in a single step, we would have turned the requirements
defined during object-oriented analysis into a set of classes and interfaces that could
be implemented in (ideally) any object-oriented programming language.

## Object-oriented programming ([OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming))
> is the process of **converting** a **design** into a **working program** that does what the product owner originally requested.

> In iterative development, a small part of the task is modeled, designed, and
programmed, and then the product is reviewed and expanded to improve each
feature and include new features **in a series of short development cycles.**
